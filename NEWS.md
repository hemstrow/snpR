# snpR 1.2.2

## UI

## Features

### Major

### Minor
* Now redistributing part of Roy Francis's `pophelper` package, since it's not on CRAN. Switched to GPL license to allow this. The package is still cited automatically when generating a citation during `plot_structure()` or `plot_structure_map`()

# snpR 1.2.1

## UI

* Added a verbose option to many functions to avoid putting quite so much noise onto the console.

## Features

### Major

* Added `calc_he()` for traditional H<sub>E</sub> = 2pq calculation. Note that this produces results *almost* identical to `calc_pi()`.
* Added `calc_hs()` for Coltman et al (1999)'s individual heterozygosity.

### Minor

* Renamed `calc_SFS()` and `calc_pairwise_LD_heatmap()` to lowercase for consistency.
* Got rid of `sfs` arguments in `plot_sfs()` and `calc_direcitonality()`. They now just take provided sfs objects as x, consistent with other functions.
* Reworked `calc_pairwise_fst()` bootstrapping to be more memory efficient.
* Added a `chr_order` argument to `plot_manhattan()` to allow for manual resorting of chromosomes (since factors are coerced away in `snpRdata` objects).
* Added a `highlight_style` argument to `plot_manhattan()` to allow for coloring SNPs instead of labeling them if highlighted.
* Added a `verbose` option (defaulting to `TRUE`) for `filter_snps()` to suppress all of the filtering reports.

## Documentation

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Cleaned up the association testing vignette.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug in `run_random_forest()` where formulas would be incorrectly specified the first time a line of code was run due to a weird environment scope issue.
* Fixed a bug in `get.snpR.stats()` when requesting fst values from both a facet with and without fst calculated would throw an error during fst matrix construction. Implemented a test.
* Added ggtree citation to plot_tree.
* Fixed a bug where running no formula but generating importance estimates would throw an error in `run_random_forest()`.
* Fixed a bug where filtering a `snpRdata` object with `filter_snps()` such that no individuals or SNPs remained would result in an uninformative error. Added a test to check error messages here and in `susbet_snpR_data()` for this.
* Fixed a bug in `format_snps()` to allow for BYmax and BYmin columns to get translated to BY.max and BY.min, since periods aren't allowed in snpRdata metadata columns.
* Fixed a bug in `calc_het_hom_ratio()` complex facets would throw an error.
