\usage{
calc_isolation_by_distance(
  x,
  facets = NULL,
  x_y = c("x", "y"),
  genetic_distance_method = "Edwards",
  interpolate = "bernoulli",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{snpRdata object}

\item{facets}{character, default NULL. Facets over which to calculate IBD, as
described in \code{\link{Facets_in_snpR}}.}

\item{x_y}{character, default c("x", "y"). Names of the columns containing
geographic coordinates where samples were collected. There is no need to
specify projection formats. The first should be longitude, the second
should be latitude.}

\item{genetic_distance_method}{character, default "Edwards". The genetic
distance method to use, see \code{\link{calc_genetic_distances}}.}

\item{interpolate}{Character or FALSE, default "bernoulli". If transforming to
"sn" format, notes the interpolation method to be used to fill missing data.
Options are "bernoulli", "af", "iPCA", or FALSE. See 
\code{\link{format_snps}} for details.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[ade4]{mantel.randtest}}}
}
\value{
A snpRdata object with both geographic distance and IBD results
  merged into existing data.
}
\description{
Calculates Isolation by Distance (IBD) for snpRdata objects by comparing the
genetic distance between samples or sets of samples to the geographic
distances between samples or sets of sapmles. IBD caluclated via a mantel
test.
}
\details{
Genetic distance is caluclated via \code{\link{calc_genetic_distances}}.
Geographic distances are taken as-is for individual-individual comparisons
and by finding the geographic mean of a group of samples when sample level
facets are requested using the methods described by
\code{\link[geosphere]{geomean}}. Note that this means that if many samples
were collected from the same location, and those samples compose a single
level of a facet, the mean sampling location will be that single location.

IBD is caluclated by comparing geographic and genetic distances using a
mantel test via \code{\link[ade4]{mantel.randtest}}.

Note that geographic distance objects are also included in the returned
values.

# calculate ibd for several different facets
