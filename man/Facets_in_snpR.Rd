\description{
Facets are used to describe the ways in which data should be broken down/split
up for analysis.
}
\details{
Facet designation follows a specific format. Facets are given as a character
vector, where each entry designates one unique combination of levels over
which to seperate the data. Levels within a facet are seperated by a '.'. Each
facet can contain multiple snp and/or sample levels. Multiple facets can be
run with a single line of code.

For example, c("chr.pop", "pop") would split the data first by both chr
and pop and then by pop alone. This will produce the same result as running
the function with both "chr.pop" and then again with "pop", although the
former is typically more computationally efficient.

If multiple sample or snp levels are provided in a single facet, the data is
simultaniously broken up by \emph{both} levels. For example, the facet
c("fam.pop") would break up the data provided in \code{\link{stickSNPs}} by
both family and population, and would produce levels such as "ASP.A" for
individuals in the ASP population and in family A.

All listed facet levels must match column names in the snp of sample level
facet data provided when constructing a snpRdata object with
\code{\link{import.snpR.data}}. The order of the provided levels within each
facet does not matter.

In many cases, specifying "all" as a facet will calculate or return statistics
for all previously run facets.

The base facet--that is, the entire data with no categorical devisions--can be
specified with ".base" and is typically the facet defaulted to when facets =
NULL.
