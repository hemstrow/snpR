\title{Checks for duplicated samples in snpRdata.}
\usage{
check_duplicates(x, y = 1:ncol(x), id.col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{snpRdata object}

\item{y}{numeric or character, default 1:ncol(x). Designates the sample
indices or IDs in x for which duplicates will be checked.}

\item{id.col}{character, default NULL. Designates a column in the sample
metadata which contains sample IDs. If provided, y is assumed to contain
sample IDs uniquely matching those in the the sample ID column.}
}
\value{
A list containing: \itemize{ \item{best_matches: } Data.frame listing
  the best match for each sample noted in y and the percentage of genotypes
  identical between the two samples. \item{data: } A list containing the
  match proportion between each sample y and every sample in x, named for the
  samples y. }
}
\description{
Searches through a snpR dataset and, for every designated sample, determines
the proportion of identical genotypes in every other sample. This function
\emph{is not overwrite safe}.
}
\details{
If an id column is specified, y should contain sample IDs matching those
contained in that column. If not, y should contain sample indices instead.
The proportion of identical genotypes between matching samples and all other
samples are calculated. By default, every sample will be checked.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# check for duplicates with sample 1
check_duplicates(stickSNPs, 1)

# check duplicates using the .samp.id column as sample IDs
check_duplicates(stickSNPs, 1, id.col = ".sample.id")
}
