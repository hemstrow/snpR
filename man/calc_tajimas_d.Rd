\title{Tajima's D from SNP data.}
\usage{
calc_tajimas_d(
  x,
  facets = NULL,
  sigma = NULL,
  step = 2 * sigma,
  par = FALSE,
  triple_sigma = TRUE,
  global = FALSE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{snpRdata. Input SNP data.}

\item{facets}{character. Categorical metadata variables by which to break up
analysis. See \code{\link{Facets_in_snpR}} for more details. If no snp level
facets are provided, the calculated Tajima's D will be for the entire
genome.}

\item{sigma}{numeric, default NULL. Sliding window size, in kilobases. Each
window will include all SNPs within 3*sigma or sigma kilobases depending on
the \code{triple_sigma} argument. If either sigma or step are NULL, the
entire snp subfacet will be done at once (for example, the whole
chromosome).}

\item{step}{numeric or NULL, default \code{2*sigma} (non-overlapping windows). Number
of bases to move between each window, in kilobases. If either sigma or step
are NULL, the entire snp subfacet will be done at once (for example, the
whole chromosome).}

\item{par}{numeric or FALSE, default FALSE. If numeric, the number of cores to
use for parallel processing.}

\item{triple_sigma}{logical, default TRUE. If TRUE, sigma will be tripled to
create windows of 6*sigma total.}

\item{global}{logical, default FALSE. If TRUE, all window parameters will
be ignored and the global Tajima's D across all sites will instead be 
calculated. In this instance, \code{global_x} values will be merged into
the \code{weighted.means} slot instead of weighted mean values and no values
will be merged into the \code{window.stats} slot.}

\item{verbose}{logical, default FALSE. If TRUE progress will be printed to the
console.}
}
\value{
snpRdata object, with Watterson's Theta, Tajima's Theta, and Tajima's
 D for each window merged in to the window.stats slot.
}
\description{
\code{Tajimas_D} calculates Tajima's theta/pi, Watterson's theta, and Tajima's
D over a sliding window.
}
\details{
Tajima's D compares estimates of theta based on either the number of observed
pairwise differences (Tajima's theta) and the number of substitutions vs
expected total tree length (Watterson's Theta). Since low frequency minor
variants contribute to these statistics and they rely on the ratio of the
number of variants vs the number of sequenced non-polymorphic sites, this
function should only be run on data that is \emph{unfiltered} aside from the
removal of poorly sequenced bases, etc.

The data can be broken up categorically by either SNP and/or sample metadata,
as described in \code{\link{Facets_in_snpR}}.

\examples{
# slow, so not run
\dontrun{
# broken by population, windows across linkage group
x <- calc_tajimas_d(stickSNPs, facets = "chr.pop", sigma = 200, step = 50)
get.snpR.stats(x, "chr.pop", "tajimas_d")

# the entire population at once, note that sigma and step are NULL and
# no chromosome/linkage group/scaffold/etc set.
# this will calculate overall tajima's D without a window for each population.
x <- calc_tajimas_d(stickSNPs, facets = "pop")
get.snpR.stats(x, "pop", "tajimas_d")

# for the overall dataset, note that sigma and step are NULL
# this will calculate overall tajima's D for each chr/pop
x <- calc_tajimas_d(stickSNPs, facets = "chr.pop")
get.snpR.stats(x, "pop.chr", "tajimas_d")
