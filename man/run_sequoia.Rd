\title{Run Sequoia pedigree/parentage assignment with snpR}
\usage{
run_sequoia(
  x,
  facets = NULL,
  run_dupcheck = FALSE,
  run_parents = FALSE,
  run_pedigree = FALSE,
  min_maf = 0.3,
  min_ind = 0.5,
  ask = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{snpRdata object.}

\item{facets}{character, default NULL. Sample-specific facets over which the
sequoia is called to run. See \code{\link{Facets_in_snpR}}.}

\item{run_dupcheck}{FALSE or TRUE, default FALSE. Uses sequoia to check for 
duplicate samples in the dataset. Duplicate samples should not be included 
for parentage and pedigree construction.}

\item{run_parents}{FALSE or TRUE, default FALSE. Runs parentage assignments 
for the samples. This runs quickly and is required before using the 
run_pedigree command.}

\item{run_pedigree}{FALSE or TRUE, default FALSE. Runs pedigree construction 
for the samples. This process can take a long time.}

\item{min_maf}{numeric in 0.25:0.5, default 0.3. Minimum allele frequency
cutoff for analysis. Sequoia requires high minor allele frequencies for
parentage and pedigree construction.}

\item{min_ind}{numeric in 0.5:1, default 0.5. Removes loci sequenced in less
than this proportion of individuals. Note that \emph{individuals} with
genotypes for fewer than half of the loci will be automatically removed by
sequoia.}

\item{ask}{logical, default TRUE. Should the function ask for confirmation
before sourcing github code?}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to\code{sequoia}
(during parentage and pedigree reconstruction).}
}
\value{
A nested list with each facet specified containing sequoia output 
  summary information.
}
\description{
Runs the parentage assignment and pedigree construction tool from the
\code{sequoia} package. Note that this function \emph{is not overwrite
safe!}. This function is a wrapper which sources code from github.
}
\details{
This is an integration of the program and package written by Jisca Huisman.
Note that there are many more Sequoia specific arguments that can be added to
change from the default settings (eg. ErrorM, Tassign, Tfilt, GetMaybeRel,
etc.) See documentation for \code{sequoia}. These can be
passed to the pedigree and parentage reconstructions using the ... argument
in run_sequoia.

\examples{
# to follow an example using the stickSNPs example dataset you need 
# to add some variables that don't exist in the actual dataset.
a <- 2013:2015 #create a vector of possible birthyears
b <- c("M", "F", "U") #create a vector of possible sexes
stk <- stickSNPs
set.seed(4865)
sample.meta(stk)$BirthYear <- sample(x = a, size = nsamps(stickSNPs), 
                                     replace = TRUE) #create birth years
sample.meta(stk)$ID <- 1:nsamps(stk) #create unique sampleID
sample.meta(stk)$Sex <- sample(x= b, size = nsamps(stk), 
                               replace = TRUE) # create sexes

# slow, so not run here
